         Unexpectedly For the past 2 years We have Experienced New type of Virus Called <b> CoronoVirus</b> . Many of us are Scared as It is resulting into Dangerous Deaths . Meanwhile We have some common Questions About this Virus Which Needs To be Answered.   <br><hr>
  
  Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. <br><hr>
  
  The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. <br>
  
  The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).<br><hr>

              <strong>This is a Major Concern of Everyone Facing CoronaVirus.</strong> COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. Because it is a new virus, scientists are learning more each day. Although most people who have COVID-19 have mild symptoms, COVID-19 can also cause severe illness and even death. Some groups, including older adults and people who have certain underlying medical conditions, are at increased risk of severe illness.On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, “CO” stands for corona, “VI” for virus, and ”D” for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV.”

              <strong>How COVID-19 Spreads -</strong> 
              COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person to person, including between people who are physically near each other (within about 6 feet). People who are infected but do not show symptoms can also spread the virus to others. Cases of reinfection with COVID-19  have been reported but are rare. We are still learning about how the virus spreads and the severity of illness it causes.

        COVID-19 spreads very easily from person to person. How easily a virus spreads from person to person can vary. The virus        that causes COVID-19 appears to spread more efficiently than influenza but not as efficiently as measles, which is among    the most contagious viruses known to affect people.

        For more information about how COVID-19 spreads, visit the How COVID-19 Spreads page to learn how COVID-19 spreads and      how to protect yourself.

              <strong>It maybe Or maybe Not.</strong> Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products, or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.Clean frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. Cleaning with products containing soap or detergent reduces germs on surfaces and objects by removing contaminants and may weaken or damage some of the virus particles, which decreases risk of infection from surfaces. You may choose to also disinfect depending on certain conditions or everyday practices required by your home. To disinfect, most common Environmental Protection Agency-registered household disinfect ants will work.

              <strong>Don't Panic | Go Wisely It will be Allright </strong> Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:

              Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.
              If you have COVID-19, tell your close contacts so that they can quarantine at home and get tested.
              Use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible).
              The person who is sick should isolate. Learn when and how to isolate.
              Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.

              <strong>Definitely You Should Go for A Covid-19 Test.</strong> A viral test checks specimens from your nose or your mouth  to find out if you are currently infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

              Contact your healthcare provider or visit your state, tribal, localexternal icon, and territorial health department’s website to find the latest local information on testing. The type of viral COVID-19 tests offered differ by location. You and your healthcare provider might also consider either an at-home collection kit or an at-home test if you have signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and if you are not able to be tested by a healthcare provider or public health official.

              Long-standing systemic health and social inequities have put many people from racial and ethnic minority groups at increased risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19.
              
              In addition to those at increased risk, there are certain groups of people who require extra precautions during the pandemic.
